## HarvestHubPH E-Commerce Platform
  This repository contains the source code for a HarvestHubPH E-Commerce Platform, developed to facilitate direct transactions between farmers and customers. The platform is designed to cater to both customers and the Department of Agriculture (DA) as the merchant. 
  
  The system is built using the following technologies:
  - Front end: React JS
  - Back end: Node JS with Express JS
  - Database: MongoDB
  
## Project Overview
  The HarvestHubPH E-Commerce Platform focuses on creating a seamless user experience for customers and the Department of Agriculture. The platform allows customers to register, browse farm products, add items to their shopping cart, and place orders using a simple cash-on-delivery transaction model. On the other hand, the Department of Agriculture has administrative capabilities to manage user accounts, product listings, order fulfillment, and view sales reports.
